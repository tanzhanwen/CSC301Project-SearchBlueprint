#Individual Reports


##kamrch - Ryan Kam

* My most significan contribution was the design and implementation of the [start.html] (https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team9-repo/blob/master/Phase3/project/csc301website/searchblueprints/templates/home/start.html) page, and also most of the write-ups in all of the md files throughout all phases.
* Prior to working on this project, I had very limited knowledge on webpage development. I have learned a lot on creating webpages in html and CSS while working in the front end team on developing Search Blueprints. A major example would be the [start.html] (https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team9-repo/blob/master/Phase3/project/csc301website/searchblueprints/templates/home/start.html) page.
* I believe that my main strengths as a team member are my communication skills. I always try to stimulate communications within the team and make sure everyone is on the same page. I also helped other teammates set up their development environment when they had trouble with things such as settting up Python, Django or Haystack.
* My weakness as a team member is my lack of confidence. Often times when I need to make a decision I would be too afraid of making up my own mind, and would consult my team, which may cause inconvenience.


##magicmamba - Shivain Thapar

* My most significant individual contribution - Setting up the front end and creating the initial views/templates. Set up the design on which rest of the project was based. Also contributed for all of the write-ups (.md files).
* New techniques/issues that I learned - Learned how to use Github better, especially some new branching techniques. Got to know the MVC design pattern more, and how views and templates interact with the backend. Can use Django now for my personal projects.
* I believe that my main strengths as a team member are that I am persistent and I stick to something when I start it. I will not stop till it is completed, and work hard to solve problems/issues if I have any.
* My weakness as a team member is that sometimes I can procrastinate and don’t work if I really don’t have to or only if it is last second. Also I can get impatient with team members if I feel their work is not as good as I expect it to be. 


##lifejuggler

* My most significant individual contribution - Setting up the back-end by helping set up a version of the webcrawler, model/schema configurations and search engine (elastic search).
* New techniques/issues that I learned - Learned how the Django functions along with virtual server. I also learned how to modify/debug existing scripts/plugins to provide results that I need.
* I believe that my main strengths as a team member are that I am proficient in figuring out difficult errors and find possible solutions.
* My weakness as a team member is that due to my busy schedule, I was unable to consistently show results in github. I also have some difficulty communicating with my teammembers.

* My most significant individual contribution is that I modified the open-source crawler so that it can connect to our database and automatically stores results that it searched into database (https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team9-repo/tree/master/Phase2/project/csc301website/searchblueprints/webcrawler)
* New techniques that I learned from the project: I learned how Github and Django platform work better. And I got to know how to set up a database in my PC and to interact with it using python, like query, insertion, etc.
* I think my strength is that I make efforts to study something that I am totally unfamiliar with at the beginning. For example, I totally didn't know how crawler works at the beginning. However, by reading the documentations of the open-source crawler and searching about how to interact with database using python, I can finally make it.
* My weakness as a team member is that I didn't communicate with my group mates a lot. For example, when I was confused and found something difficult, I preferred to work alone but not asked my team mates for helps and advice. Therefore, what I did was sometimes inefficient and didn't contribute a lot to our project.
