#Individual Reports


##kamrch - Ryan Kam

* My most significan contribution was the design and implementation of the [start.html] (https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team9-repo/blob/master/Phase3/project/csc301website/searchblueprints/templates/home/start.html) page, and also most of the write-ups in all of the md files throughout all phases.
* Prior to working on this project, I had very limited knowledge on webpage development. I have learned a lot on creating webpages in html and CSS while working in the front end team on developing Search Blueprints. I have also learned how to use Django to create a website.
* I believe that my main strengths as a team member is my communication skills. I always try to stimulate communications within the team and make sure everyone is on the same page. I also helped other teammates set up their development environment when they had trouble with things such as settting up Python, Django or Haystack.
* My weakness as a team member is my lack of confidence. Often times when I need to make a decision I would be too afraid of making up my own mind, and would consult my team, which may cause inconvenience.


##magicmamba - Shivain Thapar

* My most significant individual contribution - Setting up the front end and creating the initial views/templates. Set up the design on which rest of the project was based. Also contributed for all of the write-ups (.md files).
* New techniques/issues that I learned - Learned how to use Github better, especially some new branching techniques. Got to know the MVC design pattern more, and how views and templates interact with the backend. Can use Django now for my personal projects.
* I believe that my main strengths as a team member are that I am persistent and I stick to something when I start it. I will not stop till it is completed, and work hard to solve problems/issues if I have any.
* My weakness as a team member is that sometimes I can procrastinate and don’t work if I really don’t have to or only if it is last second. Also I can get impatient with team members if I feel their work is not as good as I expect it to be. 


##lifejuggler- Tom Choi

* My most significant individual contribution - Setting up the back-end by helping set up a version of the webcrawler, model/schema configurations and search engine (elastic search).
* New techniques/issues that I learned - Learned how the Django functions along with virtual server. I learned how to modify/debug existing scripts/plugins to provide results that I need. I also learned to setup proper Github docs with linking to relevant files.
* I believe that my main strengths as a team member are that I am proficient in figuring out difficult errors and find possible solutions. I also try to help everyone get organized and assign tasks when they ask.
* My weakness as a team member is that due to my busy schedule, I was unable to consistently show results in github. I also have some difficulty communicating with my teammembers at times as well as overthink many of the issues and concepts during the course of the project. 

##sang1029 - Sangdong Kim

* My most significant contribution - Creating crawler tutorial, indexing tutorial and how it works page, adding links to all pages and improving website design.
* New techniques/issues that I learned - I learned how to use Django, creating webpages with Bootstrap CSS and Javascript.
* My strength as a team member are helping others if they had any problems, and finishing up my work on time.
* My weakness as a team member is that I sometimes did not know what others were working on and this created conflicts when I tried to submit my work on Github.

##vrprojects - Vignesh Ravi

* My most significant contribution was setting up the backend to properly follow the MVC pattern \([Commit] (https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team9-repo/commit/f46f69e2de77206c86767eb87678ac50ea8a6a8c)\). I also created functions that bridged between the backend and front end \([view.py](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team9-repo/blob/master/Phase2/project/csc301website/searchblueprints/home/views.py)\) and created the interactive tutorial scripts in the front end. \([crawler_tut.js](http://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team9-repo/blob/master/Phase2/project/csc301website/searchblueprints/static/dist/js/crawl_tut.js)\).

* New techniques/issues that I learned - I learned how to run external scripts using Django \([view.py](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team9-repo/blob/master/Phase2/project/csc301website/searchblueprints/home/views.py)\) and how to implement a search engine in the backend \([whoosh search engine](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team9-repo/tree/master/Phase2/project/csc301website/searchblueprints/searchsample)\).  I also learned about how crawlers and indexing algorithms work.

* My biggest strength as a team member is my ability to finish a task that the team gives me. During the project, I tried to solve and fix any problems that came from the tasks assigned to me.

* One weakness would be that, I didn't communicate properly with my teammates about what tasks they were doing. Sometimes I didn't know what they were working on, so whenever I pushed a code to the master, some team members had difficulty merging and it created some problems.

##tanzhanwen

* My most significant individual contribution is that I modified the open-source [crawler](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team9-repo/tree/master/Phase2/project/csc301website/searchblueprints/webcrawler) so that it can connect to our database and automatically stores results that it searched into database 
* New techniques that I learned from the project: I learned how Github and Django platform work better. And I got to know how to set up a database in my PC and to interact with it using python, like query, insertion, etc.
* I think my strength is that I make efforts to study something that I am totally unfamiliar with at the beginning. For example, I totally didn't know how crawler works at the beginning. However, by reading the documentations of the open-source crawler and searching about how to interact with database using python, I can finally make it.
* My weakness as a team member is that I didn't communicate with my group mates a lot. For example, when I was confused and found something difficult, I preferred to work alone but not asked my team mates for helps and advice. Therefore, what I did was sometimes inefficient and didn't contribute a lot to our project.
