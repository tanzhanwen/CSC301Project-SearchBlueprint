#Individual Reports

* My most significan contribution was the design and implementation of the [start.html] (https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team9-repo/blob/master/Phase3/project/csc301website/searchblueprints/templates/home/start.html) page, and also most of the write-ups in [Phase2/Process.md] (https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team9-repo/blob/master/Phase2/Process.md), [Phase2/Product.md] (https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team9-repo/blob/master/Phase2/Product.md), [Phase3/Process.md] (https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team9-repo/blob/master/Phase3/Process.md), and [Phase3/Product.md] (https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team9-repo/blob/master/Phase3/Product.md).
* Prior to working on this project, I had very limited knowledge on webpage development. I have learned a lot on creating webpages in html and CSS while working in the front end team on developing Search Blueprints. A major example would be the [start.html] (https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team9-repo/blob/master/Phase3/project/csc301website/searchblueprints/templates/home/start.html) page.
* I believe that my main strengths as a team member are my communication skills. I always try to stimulate communications within the team and make sure everyone is on the same page. I also helped other teammates set up their development environment when they had trouble with things such as settting up Python, Django or Haystack.
* My weakness as a team member is my lack of confidence. Often times when I need to make a decision I would be too afraid of making up my own mind, and would consult my team, which may cause inconvenience.

* My most significant individual contribution - Setting up the front end and creating the initial views/templates. Set up the design on which rest of the project was based. Also contributed for all of the write-ups (.md files).
* New techniques/issues that I learned - Learned how to use Github better, especially some new branching techniques. Got to know the MVC design pattern more, and how views and templates interact with the backend. Can use Django now for my personal projects.
* I believe that my main strengths as a team member are that I am persistent and I stick to something when I start it. I will not stop till it is completed, and work hard to solve problems/issues if I have any.
* My weakness as a team member is that sometimes I can procrastinate and don’t work if I really don’t have to or only if it is last second. Also I can get impatient with team members if I feel their work is not as good as I expect it to be.
