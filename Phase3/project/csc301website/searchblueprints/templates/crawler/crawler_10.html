<div class="hid10" id="cr10_1">
    So how do web servers identify web crawlers?
</div>
<div class="hid10" id="cr10_2">
    Crawlers typically identify themselves to a web server by using the User-agent field of an HTTP request
</div>
<div class="hid10" id="cr10_3">
    Usually the User-agent field contains a URL where the web administrator can find more information about the crawler.
</div>
<div class="hid10" id="cr10_4">
    This is different from Spambots or malicious web crawlers as they are unlikely to place identifying information in the user agent.
</div>
<div class="hid10" id="cr10_5">
    It is important to have crawlers to identify themseles so the web administrator can contact the owner of the crawler.
