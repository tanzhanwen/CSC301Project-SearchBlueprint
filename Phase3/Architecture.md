As with any project, ours has the two main components, the front end and the back end. The following describe what they are created using, and how they interact with each other.

#### Front End

The front end is responsible for the visuals of the whole system, which is a major part of our project and something we focused on. Right from the beginning we want to make sure the website is visually engaging and interactive, to involve the user in the learning process and and to give the users a greater experience.

The front end was developed using the usual languages: HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. For the design we used ‘FLAT UI’, a free bootstrap framework and theme. 

#### Back End 

For back end, we used Python and the Django framework. Some of the major components created for this web application are: 
* Our Own Web Crawler - our own basic web crawler  that is able to crawl through databases and collect data. The simple web crawler is utilized in the "Crawler" section of our tutorial so users can examine the code and learn its parts and their functionality.
