In Search Blueprints, there are two major components: front end and back end. The front end is responsible for the visuals of the whole system, and basically covers everything the users will see on their web browser. The front end mainly consists of html files with CSS style codes to improve the layout of the website; On the other hand, we have a few components that made up that whole back end. First of all, we have created our own basic web crawler using pyhton, that is able to crawl through databases and collect data. The simple web crawler will be presented in the "Crawler" webpage so users can examine the code and learn its parts and their functionality.
