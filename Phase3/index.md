#Intro

* A huge part of any good search engine is not to simply return the pages that best match the input query.
* Instead, it tries to answer the underlying question.
* Many search engines use complex algorithms to determine what result they should return.
* Indexing is used to optimize speed and performance in finding relevant documents for a search query.
* Search engine indexing collects, parses, and stores data to facilitate fast and accurate information retrieval. 
* Index design incorporates interdisciplinary concepts from linguistics, cognitive psychology, mathematics, informatics, and computer science.
