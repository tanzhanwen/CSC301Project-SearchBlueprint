##Intro

* A huge part of any good search engine is not to simply return the pages that best match the input query.
* Instead, it tries to answer the underlying question.
* Many search engines use complex algorithms to determine what result they should return.
* Indexing is used to optimize speed and performance in finding relevant documents for a search query.
* Search engine indexing collects, parses, and stores data to facilitate fast and accurate information retrieval. 
* Indexing takes place within the search engine's database, after the crawler stores the data to the database.
* The search engine index provides the result for search queries, and pages that are stored within the search engine index that appear on the search engine results page.
* Index design incorporates interdisciplinary concepts from linguistics, cognitive psychology, mathematics, informatics, and computer science.



##Implementation

Crawlers gather information and pagers which is used to create an index, where things can be looked up easily. When you search, at the most basic level, our algorithms look up your search terms in the index to find the appropriate pages. 

Indexing uses ranking algorithms to determine the best results. When you search for “cats” you don’t want a page with the word “cats” on it hundreds of times. You probably want pictures, videos or a some hilarious GIFS. Indexing systems note many different aspects of pages, such as when they were published, whether they contain pictures and videos, and much more. It is more than just keyword matching, which would lead to much less desirable results.
