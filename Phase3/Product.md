Search Blueprint is a educational web application tailored for use by university students who are interested in search engines with limited knowledge. It aims to help people to understand the basic fundamentals of how a search engine works, as well as providing some details of search engine's components such as the web crawler and basic algorithms. 

Our team believes that interactions in the web application are the first priority as it is crucial to grasp people's attention and keep them interested and stimulated. There are a lot of online search engine tutorials available, yet most of them are simply texts and pictures with zero interactions. We want to distinguish ourselves from these tutorials and provide a different learning experience for our users.

With that in mind, we created four different categories for our tutorial page. Users can go to the "How Search Engine works" page for a brief and concise tutorial on the overview of a search engine's functions. It has graphs and image representations to help users understanding the materials easier. After having a brief idea on how search engine works, the user can continue onto the website and look at the major components of a search engine. Search Blueprints provides in-depth explanations and tutorials on web-crawlers and core algorithms of a basic search engines. There will be interactive quizzes and slideshows in each of these tutorials to keep the users stimulated, as well as giving them control over the flow of the tutorial. Users can easily press the "previous" button in the slideshow to repeat the tutorial to make sure they have a clear understanding of the material, or "Next" to skip materials that they are familiar with. 
Lastly, Search Blueprint also allows user to compare two open-source search-engine algorithms and see how the results differ in terms of query, indexing, and search results. The user can greatly benefit them from examining the difference in the two results and learn how the difference in the algorithm affects the results.
