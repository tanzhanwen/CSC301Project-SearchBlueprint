## Product

Search Blueprint is an educational web application tailored for university students who are interested in search engines and want to expand their knowledge on the topic. It aims to help people to understand the basic fundamentals of how a search engine works, as well as providing some details of search engine's components such as the web crawler and basic algorithms. 

Our team believes that making an interactive component for web application is the first priority as it is crucial to grasp people's attention and keep them interested and stimulated. There are a lot of online search engine tutorials available, yet most of them are simply texts and pictures with zero interaction. We want to distinguish ourselves from these tutorials and provide a different and a more enhanced learning experience for our users.

With that in mind, we created five different parts for our tutorial. The tabs on top cane used to access any of those parts, and learn about them:
* How Search Engine works - gives a brief and concise tutorial on the overview of a search engine's functions. It has graphs and image representations to help users understanding the materials easier. After having a brief idea on how search engine works, the user can continue onto the website and look at the major components of a search engine. 
* Crawlers - this page provides in-depth explanations and tutorials on web-crawlers and core algorithms of a basic search engines. There will be interactive quizzes and slideshows in each of these tutorials to keep the users engaged, as well as giving them control over the flow of the tutorial. Users can easily press the "previous" button in the slideshow to repeat the tutorial to make sure they have a clear understanding of the material, or â€œnext" to skip materials that they are familiar with. 
* Compare - where two open-source search-engine algorithms are compared and the users can see how the results differ in terms of query, indexing, and search results. The user can greatly benefit them from examining the difference in the two results and learn how the difference in the algorithm affects the results. 
* Ranking Algorithms - 
* Indexing - 

#### Scenario 1: Learning about the web crawlers
Peter is interested in learning about search engines and came across Search Blueprints. He has brief knowledge on how a search engine works and would like to learn more on web crawlers. Peter can follow the following steps to learn more about web crawlers on Search Blueprints:

1. Go to Search Blueprints home page
2. Press the start button and reach the start page
3. Click on the Crawlers tab
4. Start the Crawlers tutorial

From here, Peter can now go through the web crawlers tutorial and learn much more about web crawlers.

#### Scenario 2: Learning about algorithms in search engines
Steven is a freshman in university and would like to learn about the algorithms in a search engine. He may do so by following these steps on Search Blueprint:

1. Go to Search Blueprints home page
2. Press the start button and reach the start page
3. Click on "How Search Engines work"
4. Read through the brief introduction on search engines
5. Click on Algorithms tab

From here, Steven can examine the basic codes in the Algorithms section and learn about how a search engine functions.
