1) As a beginner developer, I want a simple list of instructions on how to use the tutorial. 

2) As a student/ professional developer, I want to compare multiple (at least 2) search engines and their paths.

3) As a beginner/ student developer, I want to know the skeletal concept of entire search engine operations. (web crawer, indexing, etc).

4) As a beginner developer I would like an interactive glossary of computer jargons while going through the interactive tutorials so that I can get a clearer understanding of what I am doing. (possible API).

5) As a user, I want to login as a unique user so I can personalize my experience.

6) As a user, I want to favorite my search engine and/or save my progresses so that I can view or use it later.

7) As a user, I want the interactive components in the tutorial to be visually distinct (e.g: color-coded).

8) As a beginner/ student developer, I want to choose between high to low viewpoint of the search engine path.

9) As a professional developer, I would like to see the iterative progress of the code path so I would know how the search engine functions and logic from code perspective.

10) As a developer, I want to stop/ pause tutorials to inspect the code or operations so that I can inspect and predict the code for learning purposes.

11) As a professional developer, I want the options to skip to particular operations because I might be interested in specific aspect of the search engine.

12) As a developer, I want to fast foward/rewind tutorials to repeat difficult operations to help me understand the operations better.

13) As a developer, I want to take out or put in components to see the search engine operations with or without the functions, to see how much impact it has on the overall operations.

14) As a developer, I want to create/ choose my own databases for the search engine to index and store so it is more interesting to learn. 

15) As a developer, I want to 

16) As a developer, I want to   

17) As a developer, I want to  

18) As a developer, I want to  

19) As a user, I want to have a save point in the tutorial so that I can come back to it later.

20) As a user, I want to have clean and simple interface that is easy to use and understand without using the written instructions much.
