#### Release and Iteration Planning for Phase 1 ####

User stories/features we plan to implement for our first release:
* As a beginner developer, I want a simple list of instructions on how to use the tutorial. **(1)**
* As a beginner/student developer, I want to know the skeletal concept of entire search engine operations. (web crawler, indexing, etc). **(3)**
* As a beginner developer I would like an interactive glossary of computer jargons while going through the interactive tutorials so that I can get a clearer understanding of what I am doing. (possible API). **(4)**
* As a user, I want the interactive components in the tutorial to be visually distinct (e.g: color-coded). **(7)**
* As a developer, I want to fast forward/rewind tutorials to repeat difficult operations to help me understand the operations better. **(12)**

3 user stories we decided to exclude and why:
* As a developer, I want to stop/ pause tutorials to inspect the code or operations so that I can inspect and predict the code for learning purposes. **(10)**
* As a professional developer, I want the options to skip to particular operations because I might be interested in specific aspects of the search engine. **(12)**
* As a developer, I want to take out or put in components to see the search engine operations with or without the functions, to see how much impact it has on the overall operations. **(13)**

Stories planned for the first iteration:
* As a beginner developer, I want a simple list of instructions on how to use the tutorial. **(1)**
* As a beginner/student developer, I want to know the skeletal concept of entire search engine operations. (web crawler, indexing, etc). **(3)**
* (We just want to implement the first steps of the project, starting from the GUI and the most simple and basic features, so that we have our initial foundation which we will later build on.)
