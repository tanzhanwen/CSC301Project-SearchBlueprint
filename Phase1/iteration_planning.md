#### Release and Iteration Planning for Phase 1 ####

**User stories/features we plan to implement for our first release:**
* As a beginner developer, I want a simple list of instructions on how to use the tutorial. **(1)**
* As a beginner/student developer, I want to briefly know how search engine finds the websites( new and old on the internet) - webcrawler(i.e: Nutch and Hetrix, scrappy) ( 1 - Medium ) **(3)**
* As a beginner developer I would like an interactive glossary of computer jargons while going through the interactive tutorials so that I can get a clearer understanding of what I am doing. (possible API). **(4)**
* As a user, I want the interactive components in the tutorial to be visually distinct (e.g: color-coded). **(7)**
* As a developer, I want to fast forward tutorials to skip the materials that I already understand. **(12)**
* As a user, I want to rewind the tutorial to review any difficult operations so I can me understand the operations better. **(21)**
* As a beginner/student developer, I want to know the general information on how each open source index the webcrawled websites. ( 1 - Medium ) **(22)**
* As a beginner/student developer, I want to know the importance of relavancy and popularity come into play in modifying indexing and rankings of websites (SEO). ( 1 - Medium ) **(23)**


**3 user stories we decided to exclude and why:**
* As a developer, I want to stop/ pause tutorials to inspect the code or operations so that I can inspect and predict the code for learning purposes. **(10)**
* As a professional developer, I want the options to skip to particular operations because I might be interested in specific aspects of the search engine. **(11)**
* As a developer, I want to take out or put in components to see the search engine operations with or without the functions, to see how much impact it has on the overall operations. **(13)**

The 3 stories above were all excluded for the same reason, due to them not being an integral part of the vision we have for our project and due to the time all of them require to be implemented. The stories we have chosen for the first release are all required to form the basic foundation and skeleton for our web app, where as the three above are extra features that can be implemented later if time permits and are not necessary to the working of our idea. 

**Stories planned for the first iteration:**
* As a beginner developer, I want a simple list of instructions on how to use the tutorial. **(1)**
* As a beginner/student developer, I want to know the skeletal concept of entire search engine operations. (web crawler, indexing, etc). **(3)**
* (We just want to implement the first steps of the project, starting from the GUI and the most simple and basic features, so that we have our initial foundation which we will later build on.)
