Choosing the project:

Our project name is “Search Engine Internal”, which is a web application that teaches the general public the underlying operation principles of different search engines step by step, in an interactive tutorial format. It will imitate the interface of a searching engine, divide the searching process into pieces and guide the user through them. It will be interactive, for example, the user needs to click or input some values to proceed. The reason why we chose this project is that we believe search engines like, Google, Bing are something known to all but few people know how they actually work. Moreover, we found that there are few apps about this and most the existing ones are not interactive. Therefore, we think that our product is needed by and useful to the society.

To decide what project we should implement, we had a meeting and brainstormed all the possible ideas. We came up with several topics like data structure and algorithms, compiler, etc. Finally, we reached a consensus by voting and we rejected data structure or algorithms because there are already many similar apps and it is difficult to create something novel.
