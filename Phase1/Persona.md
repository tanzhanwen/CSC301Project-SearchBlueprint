  **James Smith** is a 10th grade high school student who does not have any knowledge in computer science. James is a smart, funny and passionate learner with a thirst for knowledge. One day, when he was working on his history research assignment using Google and Bing, he found out that they gave different search results. He thought Google and Bing are just different websites that use the same search engine. He started to wonder about why it was giving different results. So James searched on Google how search engines work, but as a high school student who has no knowledge in computer science, everything that he found was difficult to understand. He is looking for an easy interactive tutorial page where 10th grade students can learn about search engines. For example, technical terminologies should either come with some brief explanations, or do not appear in the tutorial page at all.

  **Suzie Que** is a 3rd year computer science student who is hoping to work for Google in the future. To be more specific, she wants to work as a search engine developer. Suzie has a decent knowledge of computer science; she has programming experience with Python, Java, and C/C++ and she understands how computer data structures, database systems and network systems work, but she did not learn anything about the search engines yet. She wants to know what algorithms search engines use, how the search engine interacts with the database and more, so she tried to find information online, but all she found was books with hundreds of pages and online tutorials with text and images only. As a university student, she does not have an enough time to read all the information and it is hard to learn in this way. Suzie is looking for an interactive tutorial that teaches how search algorithms works. She prefers videos and a more visual experience over slides and writing notes. Since Suzie is an experienced developer, she believes that a page showing just the basic concepts of search engines will not be enough for her. She would like to go more in-depth with this topic, and would like to see more of the inner workings and not just the top layer of the search engines.

  **Steve Johnson** is an expert software developer who is working in a small start-up company that is trying to make a new search engine. Steve is an expert in few programming languages, and he has several years of experience in software development. Steve knows how search engines work, but to quickly remind himself of how they work, he wants to see a quick tutorial. He does not need to know all the details, but a tutorial page will give him an idea about how he will create a new search engine. Comparison of different search engines may also help Steve to build an optimal search engine.
