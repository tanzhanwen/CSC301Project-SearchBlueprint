  James Smith is a 10th grade high school student who does not have any knowledge in computer science. James is smart, funny and a passionate learner who wants to learn everything. One day, when he was working on his history research assignment using Google and Bing, he found out that they gave different search results. He thought Google and Bing are just different websites that uses the same search engine. He started to wonder about why it was giving different results. So James searched on Google how search engines work, but as a high school student who has no knowledge in computer science, everything that he found was difficult to understand. He is looking for an easy interactive tutorial page where 10th grade students can understand. For example, he does not want to see a terminology that only a computer science student would know or if there is one, he wants to see an easy explanation. 

  Suzie Que is a 3rd year computer science student who is hoping to get into Google company in the future. To be more specific, she wants to work as a search engine developer. Suzie has a decent knowledge in computer science; she has programming experience with Python, Java, and C/C++ and she understands how computer data structures, database systems and network systems work. But she did not learn anything about the search engines yet. She wants to know what algorithms do search engines use, how the search engine interacts with the database and more. So she tried to find information about the search engines, but all she found was books with hundreds of pages and internet webpages with texts only. As a university student, she does not have an enough time to read those words. Suzie is looking for an interactive webpage tutorial that teaches about search algorithms. She prefers videos and more visual learning over slides and writing notes. Since Suzie has some background knowledge of computer science, she believe that a tutorial page that shows the basic concepts of search engines will be enough for her to learn about it. She also would like to see the code on how to build a simple search engine.

  Steve Johnson is an expert software developer who is working in a small start-up company that is trying to make a new search engine. Steve is an expert in few programming languages, and he has several years of experience in developing a software. Steve knows how search engines work, but to quickly remind himself of how they work, he wants to see a quick tutorial. He does not need to know all the details, but a tutorial page will give him an idea about how he will create a new search engine. Comparison of different search engines may also help Steve to build an optimal search engine.
