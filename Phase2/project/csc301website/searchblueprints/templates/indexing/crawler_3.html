<h3>Implementation</h3>

<div class = "hid3" id = "cr3_1">
    Crawlers gather information and pagers which is used to create an index, where things can be looked up easily. When you search, at the most basic level, our algorithms look up your search terms in the index to find the appropriate pages. 
</div>

<div class="hid3" id="cr3_2">
    Indexing uses ranking algorithms to determine the best results
</div>
<div class="hid3" id="cr3_3">
    When you search for "cats" you don't want a page with the words "cats" on it hundreds of times. You probably want pictures, videos or some hilarious GIFs.
</div>
<div class="hid3" id="cr3_4">
    Indexing systems note many different aspects of pages, such as when they were published, whether they contain picutres and videos, and much more.
</div>
<div class="hid3" id="cr3_5">
    It is more than just keyword matching, which would lead to much less desirable results.
