<h3>Example of web crawler</h3>

<div class = "hid6" id = "cr6_1">
	As you saw, the web crawler gets mostly text and meta data from websites and stores it into a database.
</div>
<div class = "hid6" id = "cr6_2">
	The data is then used by indexing programs to categorize and figure out the information of the page. 
</div>
