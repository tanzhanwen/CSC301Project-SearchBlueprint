# Agile Development Process
**Summary of planning and review meetings for sprints**
Our first meeting for phase 1 occured on Feburary 16th during the tutorial, where we just submitted 'phase 0' and waiting for TA's comments for improvement. We discussed how the user stories can be improved by further breaking some of the user stories down into more specific stories, which can help our team to have clearer objectives. 

## Sprint #1 (Week 1)
###Planning Meeting
####Date/ Location: 

Feb 9th/ tutorial Room

####Highlights:

- Received a suggestion by the TA to look into Flask as a possible alternative to Django as learning a new frame work in a short 
amount of time can be challenging for a group

- Discussed with TA on potential substories that can be created from larger stories.

###Review Meeting:

**Description of how you used GitHub issue management system (e.g. naming conventions, labels, team's conventions, etc.)**
We would each create our own private branch and would do a pull request with user story that it solved. 
Feb 3rd: In the future, all of the user stories will be created as an 'issue' and we will create pull requests with issue
number and brief description of changes made so that we have a way to visually track our progress.

**Description of any other tools (e.g. Project Management/Bug tracking) you have used. **
We created private Facebook Group to post any updates that would be of interest for the group, as well as a place to post any 
notifications that affects the project (i.e: completion of subtasks, absence from meeting, third party resources, etc).
Since github already has issue tracking, branches to manage different version tress, we agreed as a group to stick
to just Github to manage all of our project needs.

**Description of any other major decisions/conventions you may have made/used during the process, and why.**
- We will vote on a Scrum Master by end of the week, as we learned the importance of having a leader to keep everyone on 
schedule and enforce constant pace on the progress of the project.
- We decided to just branch the master instead of forking as it creates unnecesary confusing among group memebers.
- We decided to not use more popular web crawler as it is supported upto 2.7. We can try to user multiple python versions but
this cannot be implemented in the server; so it might be waste of time.
- Decided to make user stories into issues to be tracked in Github.
