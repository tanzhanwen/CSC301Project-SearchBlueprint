Our project name is “Search Blueprint”, a web application that teaches moderately experienced developers, the underlying operation principles of different search engines step by step, in an interactive tutorial format, to stimulate learning and to involve the user on a greater level for a better understanding. For this phase, we have created a landing page where all users will reach when they use Search Blueprint.
